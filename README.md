Air pollution is a global concern that poses a significant threat to human health and well-being. Exposure to air pollution has been linked to a range of health problems, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and lung cancer. The impact of air pollution on public health is reflected in the alarming statistics of deaths caused by it. According to recent studies, air pollution is responsible for millions of deaths worldwide each year.

One of the most concerning aspects of air pollution is the number of deaths it causes. Total deaths for air pollution include both outdoor and household air pollution. Outdoor air pollution is caused by sources such as transportation, industrial emissions, and wildfires, while household air pollution typically comes from the use of solid fuels for cooking and heating. The number of deaths caused by outdoor air pollution is staggering, with millions of people losing their lives each year due to this form of pollution. Similarly, the use of solid fuels for cooking and heating results in a significant number of deaths from household air pollution.
In this notebook, I will focus on several key indicators related to air pollution and its impact on human health. First, I will examine the total number of deaths caused by air pollution, including both outdoor and indoor sources. I will also explore the number of deaths specifically attributed to outdoor air pollution and household air pollution from solid fuels.

Additionally, I will analyze the death rate from air pollution per 100,000 individuals, providing insight into the risk of mortality associated with exposure to air pollution. I will also examine the death rates for ambient particulate matter and ozone pollution, which are two of the most significant contributors to air pollution-related mortality. By analyzing these indicators, we can gain a better understanding of the global impact of air pollution on human health and identify key areas where interventions are needed to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality.
